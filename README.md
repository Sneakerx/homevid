Improve old home videos

This video processing suite comprises three components that are tailored to old VHS film:
1. Test data generator
2. Processing library
3. Performance assessment

# Test Data Generator
For estimating the processing capabilities by quality metrics a simultor of VHS quality is needed. High quality video serves as "perfect input" and is degraded by processing filters to generate output in VHS-look. 

# Processing Library
The processing tries to revert the degradation and thus enhance quality. 

# Performance Assessment
The performance is measured based on objective metrics. Ultimately, the system shall be optimized for a human observer, so the metrics need to be carefully selected. The initial quality can be measured after the test data generator. The output quality after the processing library.
